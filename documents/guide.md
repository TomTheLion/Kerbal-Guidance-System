# KGS Guide

KGS requires two lexicons to be defined, kgs_settings and kgs_inputs, prior to calling the main function.

## KGS_Settings

The KGS_Settings lexicon provides several options that affect the operation of the algorithm:

Key                   | Recommended Value | Description
ipu                   |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
integrator            |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
max_step              |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
eps_newton            |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
ui_refresh_rate       |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
guidance_refresh_rate |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
debug_level           |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
eps_rkf45             |               800 | controls the speed of the kOS processor
