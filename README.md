# Kerbal-Guidance-System

Kerbal Guidance System or KGS is a program written for Kerbal Space Program in kerboscript that can guide a launch vehicle on an optimal trajectory to a desired orbit while maximizing payload. KGS offers the specification of three types of orbits:

* Unconstrainted orbital plane
* Constrained inclination
* Constrained inclination and longitude of the ascending node

KGS allows for the specification of various parameters to define the trajectory including:

* burn out altitude
* apoapsis
* periapsis
* inclination
* longitude of the ascending node
* payload
* coast phases
* jettison events
* action group triggers
* ullage

KGS can estimate optimal launch time and launch azimuth then fly a simple trajectory during the atmospheric phase of ascent. KGS provides several options to optimize the atmospheric ascent phase including:

* Pitch over time
* Pitch over angle
* Pitch over angle rate
* Roll time
* Roll angle
* Launch azimuth adjustment
* Launch time adjustment
* Throttle control
